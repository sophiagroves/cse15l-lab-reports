1. The `handleRequest` method is called. 
2. The relevant argument to the `handleRequest method` is the instance of the `URI` class, which is the URL requested by me: [http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=Hello](http://localhost:4000/add-message?s=Hello). The relevant field for the `Handler` class is the `allparameters` field, which is a `List<String>`. The value of the `allparameters` field is a list with one string element, `"Hello"`.
3. Yes, the value of the `allparameters` field changed from an empty list, to a list with the string element `"Hello"`.

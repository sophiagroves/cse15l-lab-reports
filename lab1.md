**Hello! Here is a step by step tutorial on how to log into a course specific acount on ieng6.**

**Step One: installing VScode**
1) I already have VScode on my laptop, so I skip installing and simply open the program from my mac's dock.

**Step Two: remotely connecting**
1)  I skip installing git step because I am not using a windows device.
2)  I open a terimnal on VScode using the terminal > new terminal option at the top of the screen.
3)  I type into the terminal my unique course specific account, which for this class is: $ ssh cs15lsp23nn@ieng6.ucsd.edu where $ denotes the beginning of my command.
5)  If the following message appears for connecting to a server for the first time: Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? I will type yes into the terminal then enter.
6)  I type in my password when prompted, noting that though nothing shows up when typing it still is being inputed.
7)  I will know I'm logged in when I receive the message Hello cs15lsp23nn, you are currently logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu.


**Step Three: Trying some commands**
1) To try some command, I can enter any of the following into the terminal : cd, cd ~, ls -lat, ls -a, etc.
